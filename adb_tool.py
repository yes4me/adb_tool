'''
Before executing the code, it will define a few special variables.
For example, if the python interpreter is running that module (the source file) as the main program,
it sets the special __name__ variable to have a value "__main__". If this file is being imported from another module,
__name__ will be set to the module's name.
In short, __main__ will be called only if adb_tool.py is executed. If it is imported, this will not be executed
